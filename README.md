# House Price Prediction 

##  Objective
To predict house prices based on features like number of rooms, area, location, etc., using machine learning algorithms.

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building â€“ Linear Regression, XGBoost
5. Model Evaluation â€“ RÂ² Score, MAE, RMSE
